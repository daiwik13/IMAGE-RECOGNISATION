Update 8.17
Modified data preprocessing in dataf.py. Adjust as needed based on your own dataset. (Data augmentation is also important for good results.)

Added post.py as a demo for post-processing. The main idea is to use the set of line segments obtained from the Hough transform (HoughLinesP) to repair broken straight lines.
